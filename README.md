# Agartha 1.0 HTML5

A demo made in 2010 for a game that was never finished. You are Kuros, a Dolphin who lives in a world that was once populated by an ancient civilization. Speak to other dolphins, and orcas, collect all the coins and fight the boss at the end of the stage.

# Why was this Abandoned?

This was the first game (and game engine) that I ever built and because of that I ran into alot of walls as I tried to expand it. At the time HTML5 was very limited, and there were better alternatives to choose from.
